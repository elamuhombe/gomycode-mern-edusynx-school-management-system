# School Management System Project README

## 1. Introduction
This README provides an overview of the proposed School Management System project. The purpose of this system is to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication between stakeholders, and provide valuable insights through data analysis.

## 2. Objectives
The objectives of the School Management System project are as follows:
- **Centralize Administrative Tasks**: Consolidate student records, teacher information, grades, attendance, and financial data into a unified system.
- **Develop a User-Friendly System**: Create an intuitive, scalable, and secure platform for managing school operations.
- **Facilitate Communication**: Enable seamless interaction among administrators, teachers, parents, and students.
- **Improve Decision Making**: Utilize data-driven insights and analytics to enhance decision-making processes.

## 3. Scope
### 3.1 Modules and Functionalities
The system comprises the following modules:
- **Student**: Manages student details including biographical information, contact details, and enrollment information.
- **Teacher**: Handles teacher information such as personal details and performance metrics.
- **Attendance**: Tracks student attendance records.
- **Fee Management**: Manages fee collection and payment history.
- **Parents**: Provides parents with access to their child's academic records, attendance, payments, and facilitates communication with teachers and administrators.
- **Dashboards and Reports**: Generates analytical insights and reports based on data collected from various modules.

### 3.2 User Roles and Permissions
The system incorporates user roles and permissions to ensure proper access control:
- **Administrators**: Have full control over the system, including user management, role assignments, and system configuration.
- **Teachers**: Access student information, record attendance, input grades, and communicate with parents.
- **Parents**: View their child's academic progress, attendance, and communicate with teachers.
  
### 3.3 Integration Points
The system will be seamlessly integrated between front-end and back-end components, including databases and third-party services, to ensure real-time data synchronization and smooth communication.

### 3.4 Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: 
  - React with TypeScript: JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with strong typing support.
  - Material-UI: React components for faster and easier web development, with built-in accessibility and theming capabilities.
  - React Icons: Icons library for React applications.
  - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling components.
  
- **Back-end**:
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
  - Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose: NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval, with Mongoose as an elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
